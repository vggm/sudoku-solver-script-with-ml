Sudoku Solver algorithm inspired by [`@santifiorino`](https://github.com/santifiorino/sudoku.com-solver).

This project implement an algorithm that solve a sudoku clicking on the topleft and bottomright corners of the sudoku in [sudoku.com](sudoku.com).

It can be possible thanks to implement a **KNN model** that *'translate'* images of numbers to numbers.
